# Why?
This project is my solution to technical task of an interview. More information coming soon.

# Project Description
From the previous commit everything has changed a lot. I decided to use a more sophisticated approach,
so I made a Flask app, that gets the values from a producer, and posts them into db. But maybe I underestimated
the amount of work to be done, because I want to do it using async libraries, which I have never worked with before,
but anyway it is worth it. Now it just produces data, posts them to a Flask app, and that's it.
We will see what I will do tomorrow.
